Given a fixed-length integer array arr, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right. 

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4] 
```

Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

 

Constraints:
```
1 <= arr.length <= 104
0 <= arr[i] <= 9
```
